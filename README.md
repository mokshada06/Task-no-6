# Subqueries and Nested Queries

# Description
This project is part of the SQL Developer Internship Task 6.
It focuses on implementing subqueries (scalar, correlated, and nested) using a real-world themed database of a **Movie Streaming Platform**.
The task showcases advanced SQL logic using subqueries within `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses.

All tables are linked via **Primary and Foreign Keys** to maintain referential integrity and represent realistic interactions on a movie streaming platform.

# Tools Used
**MySQL Workbench** – to create and manage tables, and run subqueries  
**Snipping Tool** – for table screenshot capture  
**GitHub** – to version control and share the project
